# Dlango
I really like Django, but I'm not in love with Python. It's nice. D is better.

## Constraints for the sake of constraints
Personally I won't be using AI assistance for code generation or linting, with perhaps one exception--security. In my view, not augmenting security audits with powerful tools is foolish. 

I want to refrain from using AI assistance for code generation and linting because I enjoy programming. I enjoy not knowing and I enjoy figuring it out on my own. I acknowledge that this will make the project take longer. I'm fine with that.

## Compiler
Only ~~promise~~ *hope* this will compile with ldc2. DMD has never treated me right.
